-- name: CreateLogChunk :one
-- Inserts one log chunk. One chunk per statement is what makes id order write
-- order: the driver ships with a single in-flight sender, so the bigserial is
-- assigned in the order the bytes were written, by construction rather than by
-- any assumption about how a multi-row insert orders its rows.

VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)

-- name: ListLogChunksByTaskDesc :many
-- Newest-first slice: the newest page (no cursor) and scroll-back (id < cursor).
-- Backs the pagination-forward (primary) walk; List reverses to ascending for
-- display. Covered by idx_log_chunks_task_id_id (no new migration).
